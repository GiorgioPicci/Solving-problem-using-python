# Solving-problem-using-python
Carry out the evaluation of the amount of liters of gaseous fuel in a trip,
using a car that makes 12 km per liter. To obtain the calculation, the user must provide the time spent on the trip and the average speed during the trip.
In this way, it will be possible to obtain the distance traveled with the formula DISTANCE = TIME * SPEED. Having the value of the distance,
it is enough to calculate the amount of liters of fuel used in the trip, with the formula: USED_LITERS = DISTANCE / 12.
The program must present the values of the average speed, time in the trip, the distance traveled and the amount of liters used on the trip
